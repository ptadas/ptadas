Instead of being boring and just calling the site my blog I decided to name it `Warehouse labs`, as it gives me more freedom of what I type of content I can publish here, i.e. new projects, blog posts, presentations, etc. It's also a lot less boring than just a blog. The hypothetical warehouse is rather empty as of this moment, but as many things in life it'll soon be cluttered with magical things.
